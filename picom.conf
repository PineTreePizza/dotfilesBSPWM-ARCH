#           Animations         #

# !These animations WILL NOT work correctly for any other wm other than phyOS-dwm fork!

# fly-in: Windows fly in from random directions to the screen
# maximize: Windows pop from center of the screen to their respective positions
# minimize: Windows minimize from their position to the center of the screen
# slide-in-center: Windows move from upper-center of the screen to their respective positions
# slide-out-center: Windows move to the upper-center of the screen
# slide-left: Windows are created from the right-most window position and slide leftwards
# slide right: Windows are created from the left-most window position and slide rightwards
# slide-down: Windows are moved from the top of the screen and slide downward
# slide-up: Windows are moved from their position to top of the screen
# squeeze: Windows are either closed or created to/from their center y-position (the animation is similar to a blinking eye)
# squeeze-bottom: Similar to squeeze, but the animation starts from bottom-most y-position
# zoom: Windows are either created or destroyed from/to their center (not the screen center)
